# PyNutil
PyNutil is currently under development.

PyNutil is a Python library for brain-wide quantification and spatial analysis of features in serial section images from mouse and rat brain . It aims to replicate the Quantifier feature of the Nutil software (RRID: SCR_017183). It builds on registration to a standardised reference atlas with the QuickNII (RRID:SCR_016854) and VisuAlign software (RRID:SCR_017978) and feature extraction by segmentation with an image analysis software such as ilastik (RRID:SCR_015246). 

For more information about the QUINT workflow:

# Usage
As input, PyNutil requires:
1. An alignment JSON created with the QuickNII or VisuAlign software
2. A segmentation file for each brain section with the feature-of-interests displayed in a unique RGB colour (it currently accepts many image formats: png, jpg, jpeg, etc).


Note: The atlases available in PyNutil are those listed via the [brainglobe_atlasapi](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-atlasapi).

PyNutil requires Python 3.8 or above

```python
from PyNutil import PyNutil
"""
Here we define a quantifier object
The segmentations should be images which come out of ilastik, segmenting an object of interest
The alignment json should be out of DeepSlice, QuickNII, or VisuAlign, it defines the sections position in an atlas
The colour says which colour is the object you want to quantify in your segmentation. It is defined in RGB
Finally the atlas name is the relevant atlas from brainglobe_atlasapi you wish to use in Quantification.
"""
pnt = PyNutil(
    segmentation_folder='../tests/test_data/big_caudoputamen_test/',
    alignment_json='../tests/test_data/big_caudoputamen.json',
    colour=[0, 0, 0],
    atlas_name='allen_mouse_25um'
)

pnt.get_coordinates(object_cutoff=0)

pnt.quantify_coordinates()

pnt.save_analysis("PyNutil/outputs/myResults")
```
PyNutil generates a series of reports in the folder which you specify.
